hi i opened this with turing

implemented:
custom obfusctation
fake game
download files
open browser
open files

planned (if i continue):
random file copy and rename locations (was going to do this but its quite a bit of work that i don't really feel like doing)
actually add pictures in the tic tac toe so it doesn't seem sketchy
bloat the fake images to look like they are actually images, easily done but didn't want to destroy school computers when trying to access the files.
