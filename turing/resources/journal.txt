figured out I can use 'system("powershell -command \"wget -O <file> <url>\"",ret)' to bypass the schools restriction on cmd.exe by running the command in powershell.exe instead. apparently the IT guy lacks knowledge of powershells existence.

tried making binary-plaintext conversion to use as obfuscation but decided that was a lot of work that i didn't wanna do

settled for random variable, procedure, and filenames for obfuscation because it was far easier and needed no extra work to start doing. made use of 'include <fileName>' to make reading the code more confusing and time consuming.
also named some procedures things that would make it look like a tic tac toe game to mask it a bit

using fake image files to contain turing procedures used to rename the files and run them
thought about bloating the files with ï·½ characters but didn't see a point as i'm not actively trying to hide the malware

while writing a password stealer i realized this is a school project and the school computers have very limited permissions so i've decided i'm just making an example malware instead. harmless but shows the potential damage

wrote these github pages to document everything

lesson learnt is that everything can be malware. instead of opening links, and invisible powershell being used to download a .txt file i could have made something far more malicious

100% pls mr bennet!
